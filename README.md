Web-suslik is a simple CLI web-crawler build with Cobra and colly.
It's very simple since I don't have a lot of experience with GO and it's my first time buiding a more complex CLI tool than an input from user.  
It only has two commands:
 - ```sl [domain name thats not .com, url] ``` 
 - ```slcom [url]```
both of these stand for suslinks - scraping for links.



Why?

I had the weirdest realisation a couple of night ago.  I haven't built anything in a while. 
Yeah sure, I code for work and I do a lot of infra outside of my 9-5 but I rarely  just sit to code to see if I can build my idea and have fun. So here't is. My late-night idea.

Here's a picture of a suslik:
